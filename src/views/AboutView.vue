    <p>Sudoku (/su:'doʊku:, -'dɒk-, sə-/; Japanese: 数独, romanized: sūdoku,
    lit. 'digit-single'; originally called Number Place)[1] is a logic-based,[2][3]
    combinatorial[4] number-placement puzzle.</p>
    <br />
    <p>In classic Sudoku,
    the objective is to fill a 9 x 9 grid with digits so that each column,
    each row, and each of the nine 3 x 3 subgrids that compose the grid
    (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits
    from 1 to 9.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid,
    which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.</p>
